Backing the next version of JUnit
=================================

Some developers have started a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/junit-lambda) to trigger the development of the next version of JUnit.

* On JAXenter: [Crowdfunding for JUnit Lambda is underway](https://jaxenter.com/crowdfunding-for-junit-lambda-is-underway-119546.html)

Because I believe the JUnit library needs to evolve, I have participated in the fundraising campaign.
