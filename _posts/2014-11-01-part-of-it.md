Let be part of it
=================

I really appreciate to read blogs from all over the world...
I think this is an incredible way to learn from others and to share knowledge.

I have opened this blog to be part of it.
I see it as a way to share knowledge.
I will use this channel to write about the ideas I have or the ideas I have seen somewhere else.

I have hosted this blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmini/jmini.github.io). 
Maybe someone will send me some [pull requests](https://github.com/jmini/jmini.github.io/pulls) to improve the content (update broken links, fix typo, rephrase the text).
Feel free to use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jmini/jmini.github.io/issues) to suggest new topic or to start a discussion.
