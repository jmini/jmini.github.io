I am working a lot on the link:https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator[OpenAPI Generator] project these days.
This means that I need to edit OpenAPI Specification files a lot.
A specification file is a `*.yaml` file that describes a REST API.

In Eclipse IDE I have installed the link:https://github.com/RepreZen/KaiZen-OpenApi-Editor[KaiZen OpenAPI Editor] plugin.
This is an Xtext editor that provides everything that you need to be efficient with your OpenAPI specification: outline, code completion, jumps for references, renaming support...

It can be installed from the link:https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/kaizen-openapi-editor[Eclipse Marketplace].

If you use the Eclipse Installer (also called Oomph), you can add this xml snippet to your `installation.setup` file:

It is free and open-source (EPL). Enjoy.
