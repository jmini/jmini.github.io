Few months after the link:https://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/introducing-the-updated-eclipse-logo/[release of the new Eclipse Logo], I created this wallpaper for my Desktop:

I finally took the time to share it with the eclipse community.

It was created by transforming this link:https://www.flickr.com/photos/sancho_panza/54940367/[Flickr photo by Abel Pardo Lopez].
